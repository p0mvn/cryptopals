# Basis: discrete logarithm problem

# To generate keypair in DH:

# 1. All participants agree on a large prime p and a generator g
# 2. Each participant generates a random number x, which becomes their private key
# 3. Each participant derives their public key as $g^{x} \mod p$

# The fact that the discrete logarithm problem is hard means that no one should be able to recover the private key from the public key.

# $g, g^1,g^2,g^3, g34121132112901242,â€¦\mod p$

# DH public key = $g^{34121132112901242} \mod p$

# DH private key = 34121132112901242

# Choosing a private key in DH is like choosing an index in a list of numbers produced by a generator g. The discrete log problem is to find the index from the number alone.

# How do we use this math for key exchange?

# - Alice: has private key a and public key $A = g^{a} \mod p$
# - Bob: has a private key b and a public key $B = g^b \mod p$

# Alice can compute shared secret S as $B^a \mod p$

# Bob can compute shared secret S as $A^b \mod p$

# $B^a = (g^b)^a = g^ab = (g^a)^b = A^b \mod p$
